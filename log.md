# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: May 26, 2020

**Today's Challenge**: 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5848565e273af816fb000449/train/ruby

**Thoughts:** 
I came up with a solution that technically worked but it was so inefficient, Codewars timed out.
I unlocked the solutions and copied a far nicer solution. The logic was the same as my solution
but it was executed far more elegantly, using the `slice` method where as I was moving lots of things between different arrays. Took 1hr to complete.
