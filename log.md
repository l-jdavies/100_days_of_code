# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: May 26, 2020

**Today's challenge**: 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5848565e273af816fb000449/train/ruby

**Thoughts:** 
I came up with a solution that technically worked but it was so inefficient, Codewars timed out.
I unlocked the solutions and copied a far nicer solution. The logic was the same as my solution
but it was executed far more elegantly, using the `slice` method where as I was moving lots of things between different arrays. Took 1hr to complete.

## Day 1: May 27, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/53697be005f803751e0015aa/solutions/ruby

**Thoughts:**
I enjoyed completing this one. Came up with a working solution in 20 min. Looking at other people's solutions, my approach could have been replaced with the string method `tr`.

## Day 2: May 28, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://launchschool.com/exercises/8a66610c

**Thoughts:**
Completed one of the LS Ruby small problems today. I've done a lot of focused study for the RB109 written assessment this week and my brain is feeling sluggish today.

## Day 3: May 29, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5808ff71c7cfa1c6aa00006d/solutions/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Back to solving Ruby 6 kyu from Megan's RB109 interview prep list. Enjoyed this one. Took about 15 min.

## Day 4: May 30, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5c55ad8c9d76d41a62b4ede3/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Completed the problem in less than 10 min but because it was pretty easy I didn't use PEDAC, which led to me using a hack and slash approach.

## Day 5: May 31, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168b125faced29f66000005/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Much better today. Took the time to think about the return values of the method used. Solved in <10 min.

## Day 6: June 1, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59d9ff9f7905dfeed50000b0/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Solution isn't the most elegant but happy with the way I approached solving the problem.

## Day 7: June 2, 2020
**Today's challege:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59c5f4e9d751df43cf000035/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Took far longer than it should have because I made a stupid mistake, which I caught using `byebug`. Used PEDAC but I keep finding my pseudocode is more like actual code than true pseudocode.

## Day 8: June 3, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59da47fa27ee00a8b90000b4/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Completed without too many problems. Can tell my studies during the day are helping improve my abilities to problem solve.

## Day 9: June 4, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/565b112d09c1adfdd500019c/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Found the problem fairly straight forward. From now on I'll start recording myself solving my daily problem and vocialise my PEDAC approach. 

## Day 10: June 5, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5491689aff74b9b292000334/solutions/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Found this challenge much harder than previous days, mainly because I was using an elaborate approach to create substrings. Solved the problem using PEDAC and studied the solution submitted by another LS student.

## Day 11: June 6, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/545cedaa9943f7fe7b000048/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Solved the problem without any problems and made sure I vocalised the PEDAC process while solving, which definitely makes it more challenging!

## Day 12: June 7, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5264d2b162488dc400000001/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Happy with the way I solved the problem but I need to start getting into the habit of refactoring old problems.

## Day 13: June 8, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/55953e906851cf2441000032/ruby

**Thoughts:**
This one was really difficult! After 3.5 hrs I had a working solution but it's inefficient and codewars timed out on the last test case. After working on it for so long I unlocked the solutions rather than attempting to refactor.

## Day 14: June 9, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/57f8ff867a28db569e000c4a/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Took me about 20 min to solve the problem but most time was spent on PEDAC. I can see significant improvements in how I write my algorithm and pseudocode.

## Day 15: June 10, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/543e8390386034b63b001f31/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Took 40 minutes to solve this one because there are many different components. Happy that I managed to sort hash keys and values successfully!

## Day 16: June 11, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/55968ab32cf633c3f8000008/ruby

**Thoughts:**
This one was only a 7 kyu so it was fairly straightforward.

## Day 26: June 21, 2020
**Today;s challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/55960bbb182094bc4800007b/train/ruby

Easy one again today.

## Day 27: June 22, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/520b9d2ad5c005041100000f/train/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Completed a 5 kyu, the last codewars problem recommended on Juliette's blog. I'm running out of LS recommended problems to work on. Spend the rest of the day reading the LS Introduction to OOP book.

## Day 28: June 23, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/593c0ebf8b90525a62000221/ruby

**Thoughts:**
I enjoyed the problem but you have to look very carefully at the test cases to find the implicit rules of the problem.

## Day 29: June 24, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Didn't do any codewars but completed the exercises in the LS OOP with Ruby book plus made notes and Anki cards on the last two chapters.

## Day 30: June 25, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Completed the quiz at the end of OOP lesson 1 but didn't do particularly well so I'm going to read the optional material before moving on to lesson 2.

## Day 31: June 26, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Got a cold, only managed to review Anki today.

## Day 32: June 28, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Completed the first two sets of the LS RB120 - OOP exercises.

**Thoughts:**
Didn't do any coding yesterday and my brain still feels pretty foggy but it felt good to go through the exercises and feel like I have a grasp on the very basic concepts.

## Day 33: June 29, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Completed four topics within RB120 lesson 2, reviewed and created flashcards plus live coded with a student.

**Thoughts:**
I haven't done any codewars for a couple of days because RB120 is primarily exercise based at the moment plus I waste too much time looking for the 'right' type of codewars problem.

## Day 34: June 30, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Completed the easy 1 and easy 2 RB120 OOP problems and the first part of the rock, paper, scissors walk through.

## Day 35: July 1, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Completed the rock, paper, scissors walk through videos and started planning my rps bonus features.

## Day 36: July 2, 2020
**Today's challenge:** 
Not a very productive day, still thinking about how to get started on the rps bonus features. I'm going to review the course material before trying again.

## Day 37: July 3, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Taking a few days off for the long weekend, so didn't do any studying today. Reviewed flashcards and repeated a codewars problem I'd previously completed.

## Day 38: July 6, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Reviewed flashcards and re-read my RB120 lesson 2 notes.

## Day 39: July 7, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Worked on my rock, paper, lizard, spock game. Progress felt a bit slow because I was getting frustrated and made some stupid mistakes.

## Day 40: July 8, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Finished my rock, paper, scissors, spock game and started reading RB120 lesson 3. I repeated a RB109 practise codewars problem and it was a bit more of a challenge given I haven't solved any problems for a while. It's a good reminder to keep up my problem solving skills.

## Day 41: July 9, 2020
**Today's challenge:** 
I feel good about my progress today. Had a great study session then spent a lot of time reading and making notes on variable scope and the affect of inheritance on variable scope. I'm getting much better at slowing down and thinking about what I'm studying, not just focusing on progressing through the material.

## Day 42: July 10, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Completed lesson 3 then finished the easy 1, 2, 3 and medium 1 problems in lesson 4. I feel good about today but I know the plateau is looming...

**Today's challenge:**
Study session and continuing to create new notes.

## Day 47: July 15, 2020
