# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: May 26, 2020

**Today's challenge**: 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5848565e273af816fb000449/train/ruby

**Thoughts:** 
I came up with a solution that technically worked but it was so inefficient, Codewars timed out.
I unlocked the solutions and copied a far nicer solution. The logic was the same as my solution
but it was executed far more elegantly, using the `slice` method where as I was moving lots of things between different arrays. Took 1hr to complete.

## Day 1: May 27, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/53697be005f803751e0015aa/solutions/ruby

**Thoughts:**
I enjoyed completing this one. Came up with a working solution in 20 min. Looking at other people's solutions, my approach could have been replaced with the string method `tr`.

## Day 2: May 28, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://launchschool.com/exercises/8a66610c

**Thoughts:**
Completed one of the LS Ruby small problems today. I've done a lot of focused study for the RB109 written assessment this week and my brain is feeling sluggish today.

## Day 3: May 29, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5808ff71c7cfa1c6aa00006d/solutions/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Back to solving Ruby 6 kyu from Megan's RB109 interview prep list. Enjoyed this one. Took about 15 min.

## Day 4: May 30, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5c55ad8c9d76d41a62b4ede3/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Completed the problem in less than 10 min but because it was pretty easy I didn't use PEDAC, which led to me using a hack and slash approach.

## Day 5: May 31, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168b125faced29f66000005/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Much better today. Took the time to think about the return values of the method used. Solved in <10 min.

## Day 6: June 1, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59d9ff9f7905dfeed50000b0/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Solution isn't the most elegant but happy with the way I approached solving the problem.

## Day 7: June 2, 2020
**Today's challege:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59c5f4e9d751df43cf000035/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Took far longer than it should have because I made a stupid mistake, which I caught using `byebug`. Used PEDAC but I keep finding my pseudocode is more like actual code than true pseudocode.

## Day 8: June 3, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59da47fa27ee00a8b90000b4/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Completed without too many problems. Can tell my studies during the day are helping improve my abilities to problem solve.

## Day 9: June 4, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/565b112d09c1adfdd500019c/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Found the problem fairly straight forward. From now on I'll start recording myself solving my daily problem and vocialise my PEDAC approach. 

## Day 10: June 5, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5491689aff74b9b292000334/solutions/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Found this challenge much harder than previous days, mainly because I was using an elaborate approach to create substrings. Solved the problem using PEDAC and studied the solution submitted by another LS student.

## Day 11: June 6, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/545cedaa9943f7fe7b000048/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Solved the problem without any problems and made sure I vocalised the PEDAC process while solving, which definitely makes it more challenging!

## Day 12: June 7, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5264d2b162488dc400000001/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Happy with the way I solved the problem but I need to start getting into the habit of refactoring old problems.

## Day 13: June 8, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/55953e906851cf2441000032/ruby

**Thoughts:**
This one was really difficult! After 3.5 hrs I had a working solution but it's inefficient and codewars timed out on the last test case. After working on it for so long I unlocked the solutions rather than attempting to refactor.

## Day 14: June 9, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/57f8ff867a28db569e000c4a/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Took me about 20 min to solve the problem but most time was spent on PEDAC. I can see significant improvements in how I write my algorithm and pseudocode.

## Day 15: June 10, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/543e8390386034b63b001f31/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Took 40 minutes to solve this one because there are many different components. Happy that I managed to sort hash keys and values successfully!

## Day 16: June 11, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/55968ab32cf633c3f8000008/ruby

**Thoughts:**
This one was only a 7 kyu so it was fairly straightforward.

## Day 17: June 12, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
LS medium Ruby small problems

**Thoughts:**
Going to focus on drilling LS problems in preparation for my RB109 interview assessment.

## Day 18: June 13, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Reviewing LS small Ruby problems.

**Thoughts:**
Same as yesterday, drilling LS problems for assessment.

## Day 19: June 14, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/58f5c63f1e26ecda7e000029/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Worked on a solution that I couldn't solve during live coding session.

## Day 20: June 15, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
Drilling the easy LS small Ruby problems.

**Thoughts:**
Drilling the easy problems to refresh a broad range of Ruby syntax. Pair programming with another LS student later today.

4 hours of 6 and 5 kyu codewar problems.
