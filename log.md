# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: May 26, 2020

**Today's Challenge**:

**Thoughts:** 
I came up with a solution that technically worked but it was so inefficient, Codewars timed out.
I unlocked the solutions and copied a far nicer solution. The logic was the same as my solution
but it was executed far more elegantly, using the `slice` method where as I was moving lots of things between different arrays. Took 1hr to complete.

**Thoughts:**
I enjoyed completing this one. Came up with a working solution in 20 min. Looking at other people's solutions, my approach could have been replaced with the string method `tr`.

**Today's challenge:**

**Thoughts:**
Completed one of the LS Ruby small problems today. I've done a lot of focused study for the RB109 written assessment yesterday and my brain is feeling sluggish today.
