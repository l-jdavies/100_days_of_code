# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: May 26, 2020

**Today's challenge**: 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5848565e273af816fb000449/train/ruby

**Thoughts:** 
I came up with a solution that technically worked but it was so inefficient, Codewars timed out.
I unlocked the solutions and copied a far nicer solution. The logic was the same as my solution
but it was executed far more elegantly, using the `slice` method where as I was moving lots of things between different arrays. Took 1hr to complete.

**Thoughts:**
I enjoyed completing this one. Came up with a working solution in 20 min. Looking at other people's solutions, my approach could have been replaced with the string method `tr`.

## Day 2: May 28, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://launchschool.com/exercises/8a66610c

**Thoughts:**
Completed one of the LS Ruby small problems today. I've done a lot of focused study for the RB109 written assessment this week and my brain is feeling sluggish today.

## Day 3: May 29, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5808ff71c7cfa1c6aa00006d/solutions/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Back to solving Ruby 6 kyu from Megan's RB109 interview prep list. Enjoyed this one. Took about 15 min.

## Day 4: May 30, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5c55ad8c9d76d41a62b4ede3/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Completed the problem in less than 10 min but because it was pretty easy I didn't use PEDAC, which led to me using a hack and slash approach.

## Day 5: May 31, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5168b125faced29f66000005/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Much better today. Took the time to think about the return values of the method used. Solved in <10 min.

## Day 6: June 1, 2020
**Today's challenge:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59d9ff9f7905dfeed50000b0/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Solution isn't the most elegant but happy with the way I approached solving the problem.

## Day 7: June 2, 2020
**Today's challege:**
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59c5f4e9d751df43cf000035/ruby

**Thoughts:**
Took far longer than it should have because I made a stupid mistake, which I caught using `byebug`. Used PEDAC but I keep finding my pseudocode is more like actual code than true pseudocode.
